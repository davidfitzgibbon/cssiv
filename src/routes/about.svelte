<h1>What is CSS IV?</h1>

<p>CSS IV is a reaction to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4770"></a>debate that's been going on recently</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/blog/2020/02/20/proposed-group-css4-community-group/#comments">the group that may be set up</a>.

<h2>What's the future of this?</h2>

<p>At the moment this is just a reaction/strawman.</p>

<h2>How can I help?</h2>
